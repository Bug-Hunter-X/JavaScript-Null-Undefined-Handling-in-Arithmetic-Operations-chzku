# JavaScript Null/Undefined Handling in Arithmetic Operations

This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling `null` or `undefined` values in arithmetic operations.  JavaScript's loose typing can lead to unexpected results if these values are not handled explicitly.

## The Problem

In many languages, attempting to add `null` or `undefined` to a number would result in a runtime error.  However, in JavaScript, these values are coerced to 0, which can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug bugs.  For example:

```javascript
let result = 5 + null; // result is 5 (null coerced to 0)
```

This behavior is often unintended.  To ensure the correctness of arithmetic operations, we must explicitly check for `null` or `undefined` values before performing calculations.

## The Solution

The solution involves adding explicit checks for `null` or `undefined` values before performing any arithmetic operations.  If either operand is `null` or `undefined`, a suitable default value (e.g., 0) can be used or an appropriate error handling mechanism can be implemented.
